# Introduction
Hi! I'm Agnes Noris, a year 4 student in the Framework-Based Software Design and Development course. 
By the end of the course, I expect to learn as well as gain my knowledge in modern software maintenance practices and how to work with legacy systems.
Hopefully I can pay attention to the class and avoid falling asleep since it is an 8am class for 2 consecutive days.
